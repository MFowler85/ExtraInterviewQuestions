# ExtraInterviewQuestions
These questions are from a different interview book.

This book, which I can't remember the name of, utilized the newest C++. I had no idea for the longest time how to understand the author's code! 
All of this was in preparation for an interview with Google, which I sadly did not pass...althpugh 99% of people don't survive their first interview with Google!
